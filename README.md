# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

# ReactStarterPack
React by Vite + TailwindCSS + daisyUI + React-router-dom

# bookHouse
React Layout Project with Context API and Sanity.io backend
